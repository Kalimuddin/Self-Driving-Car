# Self-Driving-Car

## Problem Definition and Data Requirements :

- In simplified minimal version, we have total 45406 sequence of images (25 minutes of video) with the corresponding Steering wheel angles as a Dataset.
- Primary Objectives are to learn the Deep Learning techniques and by applying them Predict the Sequence of Steering wheel angles.
- We choosed end to end model in which we predict Steering wheel angle for each single images. And for visualizing the output OpenCV is used.
- Required Data available at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JviaSKSBVP4z22Y5gyfwjRz-UH2C0d1q?usp=sharing
- 
- Split the dataset : Train vs Test :-
    - 80% : 20%
    - 25min : 5min
- Sequence of images -> Sequence of Steering wheel angle (regression problem)
- Dash-cam images and steering angles :

## EDA :

- read images and steering angles from driving_dataset folder : train_y, test_y
- plotting : we seen, train_y and test_y are not fully overlap, some difference in train & test

## Modelling :

- Deep-learning model : Deep Learning for regression :
    - Case-1 : not using the sequence information : image -> predict the angle (simple CNN)
    - Case-2 : images + sequence -> angle + sequence (CNN-RNN)

- Batch load the dataset :- Refer driving_data.py, "data.txt"

- NVIDIAâ€™s end to end CNN model :- Refer model.py
 
- Train the model :- Refer train.py

- After training the model what we got Refer "cmd_output" file.

- Test and visualize the output : Refer run_dataset.py
